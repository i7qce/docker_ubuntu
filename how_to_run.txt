First, go to this directory

Then, run

docker build -t <image name> .

This will build the image

Then, to run it use

docker run -it -v <volume name>:<path to mount> <image name>


usually, <volume name> is v1 and <path to mount> is /home/u1/docs

e.g. 

docker run -it -v v1:/home/u1/docs dev_img


note:

For vscode, add default extensions to Code > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Remote - Containers > Default Extensions
this ensures that, e.g. the jupyter extensions required to render notebooks are always installed when starting a new container and don't require manually reinstalling.
